The value of sigma is modified based on progress and follows the same logic as in many trust region methods: we increase sigma if we make a lot of progress (the surrogate is accurate) and decrease sigma when we arenâ€™t able to make progress (the surrogate model is inaccurate). More details about how sigma is updated is given in the original papers.\n\nAfter generating the candidate points, we predict their objective function value and compute the minimum distance to the previously evaluated point. Let the candidate points be denoted by C and let the function value predictions be s(x_i) and the distance values be d(x_i), both rescaled through a linear transformation to the interval [0,1]. This is done to put the values on the same scale. The next point selected for evaluation is the candidate point x that minimizes the weighted-distance merit function:\n\nmerit(x) = ws(x) + (1-w)(1-d(x))\n\nwhere 0 leq w leq 1. That is, we want a small function value prediction and a large minimum distance from the previously evaluated points. The weight w is commonly cycled between a few values to achieve both exploitation and exploration.

This is an extension of the SRBF strategy that changes how the candidate points are generated. The main idea is that many objective functions depend only on a few directions so it may be advantageous to perturb only a few directions.
